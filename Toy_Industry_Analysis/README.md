Toy Industry Project: Operational Analysis

Project Overview:

The Toy Industry Project focuses on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance metrics in the toy industry. This project aims to deliver actionable insights in the following areas:

1.	Sales Trends

2.	Product Level Patterns
   
3.	Store Analysis

Problem Statement:

A toy manufacturing company is facing challenges in pinpointing the factors driving sales growth or decline, despite maintaining steady revenue. The primary goal is to evaluate store-level performance and identify product trends to address challenges in optimizing inventory management and prioritizing new product launches or phasing out low-performing items. Additionally, the company seeks an operational analysis through an interactive Power BI dashboard to tackle these issues and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Objectives:

1.	Analyze Sales Performance: Examine sales trends across product categories, store locations, and compare current versus previous year sales. Highlight year-over-year (YoY) differences and progress toward business goals.
2.	 Understand Product Preferences: Evaluate product-wise sales distribution to identify top- and bottom-performing products, along with profit and units sold for each.
3.	 Monitor Store-Specific Challenges: Address operational issues at the store level by analyzing sales, YoY differences, and city-wise performance of top- and bottom-performing products.
4.	Highlight Trends & Anomalies: Identify key business insights, trends, and anomalies for operational optimization.
5.	 Support Decision-Making: Provide stakeholders with an interactive Power BI dashboard to enable informed, data-driven decisions.
